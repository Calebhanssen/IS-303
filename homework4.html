    Homework #4 (FOR loop for season wins in soccer)

    Now that you have been empowered with the knowledge of Random numbers (your previous assignment taught you this concept) 
    I want you to write a program that asks the user for a team name using a prompt and how many games make up the soccer season.

    Remember that the input you get from a prompt is always a string so you will need to use parseInt() to convert the number of 
    games in the season to an integer value and store to a variable.

    You will use the number of games within a FOR loop that will prompt the user to enter in the opponent’s name. The team name 
    entered will play a bunch of other teams (opponents) in the season but you are only storing data for that team you entered. 

    For example, the program will prompt you for your team name. After which, it will prompt you for the number of games to play. 
    As a recommendation, keep the number low or you will be typing a lot. For each game that is played you will have to enter the
     opponent's name. 

    Then generate a random number between 0 and 10 for the first team you entered and another random number with the same range
     for the opponent. You will determine who won the game and update your team’s record meaning you will need a variable to keep
      track of the wins and one for the losses (or you can subtract the total number of games from wins to calculate the losses).

    While there is a tie, you will continue to generate random numbers for the home team and opponent team until the tie is broken.
     No ties allowed.

    When one game is over, you will be prompted to enter the next opponent's name until all games have been played.

    Once the season is over, you will display your team name you entered in the beginning and their record.
    For example:
    BYU 12-2
    If the team has won at least 75% of their games then print out “NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament”. If the team has won at least 50% but less than 75% (you don't need to worry about an upper limit since the first IF statement handles this) then print out “Alternate Candidate for Covid”. Otherwise print out “See you next year”.

For example:
BYU 12-2
NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament

        // Generate random number between 10
        var myScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);
        var opponentScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);

        // While there is a tie
        while (myScore = opponentScore) {
